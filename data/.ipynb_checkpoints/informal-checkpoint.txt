It won’t let me speak in it 😔
Nice botched penile implant surgery
Hello 

I'm new to Reddit and looking forward to casual conversations. Thinking about what I want to talk about...I have lots of things on my mind.
You misspelled a bunch of words
Can we also ban posts that are literal emotional and borderline physical abuse
It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I've come to be really annoyed at all the top answers on most posts not including a judgment, and trending increasingly more towards regular advice. I was under the impression this isn't an advice sub.
The way this is written should also be banned.

Is it just me, or does it seem like some Redditors judge whether or not someone is the AH based on how difficult the action was?

For example, one topic that appears from time to time is whether or not OP was the AH for going through someone else's phone, etc. and deleting pictures taken of them without permission. In many cases, the OP is judged NTA if the was device unattended and unlocked. Comments saying OP technically broke the law by gaining unauthorized access tend to get downvoted to oblivion, and a few commenters even go as far as blaming the other person for not securing their device. But in cases where the OP had to take additional steps to gain access — such as even guessing a simple password — the votes are mostly YTA with the occasional ESH.
Fuck off to mars already!
Man, at this point we will need specific subs to be even allowed to mention that we are on reddit.

Cannot even organize shit incase the sub admins go the darkjokes route.
Can we get the bot to post "NTA, it's your wedding" to any wedding posts to save time?
> made it more clearly visible in the sidebar on old and new reddit.

That's a sign of good mods, ones who keep both the old and new looks updated.

Also, when did yall add the hair on the upper-right side of the screen?
Looks like the mod applications are fashionably late this month. Maybe they needed extra time to make an entrance. Good luck to those applying! #KarmaForMods
When Hilary was getting people together to discuss healthcare back during Bill's 2nd term the right were running around like their effing hair was on fire. "WHO IS SHE TO HAVE MEETINGS IN THE CAPITOL!? SHE'S NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL! HOW DARE SHE DISCUSS national health care issues! ?? OH! THE GRAFT AND CORRUPTION!! Now, here you are doing far, far more than discussing healthcare. What a crock of Hippocratic bullshit. Take a hike fElon. You're not wanted here.
That I agree with Bill Burr about the fact that Elon Musk is a whiny pussy who is butthurt that not even all the money in the world can stop him from being the nerd and loser he's always been, so he does Nazi salutes to ingratiate himself with morons, and his hair plugs and laminated face, coupled with the fact that he acts like a stupid middle-schooler, only underscore how much of a shallow insecure manchild he is.

On a personal note, I think that pretending you are Tony Stark because you bought a few companies and buying into your own meme-based PR to the point that you can't handle anybody disagreeing with you makes you even more of a pussy and loser than Burr said.
It's very interesting seeing people complaining here about how many rules there are, then complain on other subs like r/AITAH about posts that would be prevented by the rules we have here.

I especially appreciate the no debate posts rule. It prevents the rage bait "trans bad" posts you see everywhere else - the typical "AITA for not calling my friend/child/etc my their preferred pronouns? Their preferred pronouns are the n word and I'm white" kinda shit.

I am here because someone mentioned it somewhere else here on reddit. And being curious, I followed the link.  It was the first time I had even heard of the place despite being on reddit for a bit,
Hi. New to reddit. Not super good at talking to people, but trying to be more outgoing.
He’s the only immigrant taking away American jobs!
I’m 41 and it’s my first day on Reddit. Being here makes me feel like a Freshman that accidentally walked into AP molecular biology.
How are you
His mom should’ve aborted him
Those are two separate things though, not a slippery slope. 

“The Reddit app needs improvement” won’t degrade to personal attacks. 

Banning discussion of specific users or subreddits is sensible but worrying about “site admins” disliking Reddit criticism sounds like censorship if we can’t say anything bad about “mother Reddit”.
I am new on here
He’s a South African and should go back there. Although I don’t know if I would want to wish him on any country.
I saw a post on r/askreddit and it was if you could remove one thing, what would it be? I change my answer to this guy right here.
Hi! Just here to say I love Reddit and it’s made my crazy brain thoughts on some things not feel so crazy! 🤪
do you love reddit or hate reddit (but using it anyway)?
I noticed last week that i feel storms coming a few days before the storm. My mood is terrible in this phase. After the storm is over i feel better. Maybe some of my DNA is from sailors on the ocean in the past. :P
> Much like your mom said to your dad many years ago, "oh shit, I'm 5 days late."

Lol, worth the wait just for that.
Since Elon Musk has been pressuring Reddit’s CEO to moderate content that hurts his feelings and is likely reading this post, would you like to tell him what you think of him, Reddit?
Did Mod's Mardi Gras? This is very Mardi Gras behavior to show up on Wednesday with no real way of explaining why.
You're bald... We've all seen the pic
r/CasualConversation Welcome Thread - Month of March 01, 2025
What are you guys doing about the fake posts.  It's become glaringly obvious at this point.
Probably just me but traffic, both comments and posts, in the sub seem well down over the last month!
Hi! What about you guys. I joined it yesterday and I think that it is the awesome part of reddit I should explore
You can't have this post up. His mom will go on the news to tell everyone to be nicer to him.... again
This is a post about Reddit
That he's a doughy, middle-aged cringelord with no chin and fake hair, desperately trying to maintain a cool guy image he never had.
