Good. I get absolutely spammed by OF people to the point where my bio specifically says not interested (which is still ignored).

AITA for not opening the door to unannounced family visitors?
Yo, no bullshit; read the goddamn Aussie translated hentai ones! I was in stitches so hard I was sore for days.

Once, at a coffee shop, the cashier went to hand me my change (bills and coins). She dropped the coins in her tip jar as she did do, and gave me the bills. 

While I didn’t confront her, I did speak my my family because it astounded me that she self tipped with my money. They said I’m petty, and almost 7 years later still say I’m the unreasonable one
so you experienced gas lighting in the bud?  yeah, i think you did.  its terrifying, isnt it.
Liberal/left wing militia in the US?

First of all, I'm not condoning violence of any kind and second I'm not American so I'm asking this as an outsider just because I'm curious. 

Given the latest developments with Trump threatening neighboring regions with annexation and moving towards a more outspoken authoritarian narrative, are there armed groups in the US that could stand up for the democracy if necessary? Or are all militia groups right wing?
NTA. There's a reason they're called "*personal* hygiene products." They're not meant to be shared.
Beat jerkmate ranked, but at what cost
She is your husband's girlfriend, at the very least emotionally if not physically. If he is already being evasive and refusing to make meaningful changes when you brought the issue to him before, you will face great difficulty broaching it again "without making things worse". You need to set boundaries and follow through on the consequences when they are broken. Ask to see his phone, even if he doesn't let you his reaction will be incredibly telling. By continuing to back down and accept it nothing will ever change moving forward.

I do, but my relationship is horrendously unhealthy.

11 years. It's been declining steadily over the last 4, in part due to his inability to communicate anything. We have these long agonizing discussions (so, not arguments, per say) where I tell him how lonely and sad he makes me feel, and he explains how his self hatred sabatoges his life.

It's not a romantic moment, right? And before these conversations, there's so little emotional intimacy between us that I can't imagine having physical intimacy.

But after those convos, I feel touchy and like I want to have sex.

Imagine a puddle of mud in the desert. It's not what you want to drink, but it's the only thing around. I'd prefer emotional intimacy over something else, but sadness is all I have to work with. I do feel closer to him after. When my relationship was healthier, an argument would have turned me off from physical touch.

I'm so tired.

She didn’t flash you boy. This is not porn. Do not follow up and do not continue down this path.
I mean this with my whole heart, I am not being sarcastic or trying to be funny or anything… Is there any chance you could be gay? Because this is what a lot of gay women who were raised in a strict religious household/community felt the first time they actually did anything physical with a boy/man. They're so conditioned to not even question whether or not they could be anything other than straight that something like this happens for the first time and it kind of freaks them out because they don't feel physical attraction to the guy even though they like him a lot and feel a lot of warmth towards him. Could this be a possibility?
Yeah, I see why you guys blow yourselves up all the time.
I believe you, and I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through this. What’s happening to you is not your fault, and you deserve to be safe. There are people who care about you and can help. If there’s a teacher, counselor, or even a friend’s parent you trust, please try to tell them. You can also call a crisis hotline, there are professionals who will listen and help you make a plan to get out of this. If you are ever in immediate danger, please try to call emergency services or go somewhere safe. You deserve freedom from this, and you are stronger than what has been done to you. Please don’t give up. There are people who will believe you and fight for you.

"I've really thought about it. I can understand why you want him out of your house, and I empathize with wanting a peaceful and happy future in your home.


There's no way it would be successful for us to live together. I cannot live with him. It can't happen. 


I hope you can make plans for the future keeping in mind that I will not be involved with caring for him or living with him."

How different is the feeling from receiving a BJ while wearing a condom VS without?
I don't think either of those is a fuck up, at least not by you. It's normal to let something bake again when it's not done. And calling something "twice baked" could refer to the recipe or your fun anecdote. Who fucked up is your school staff for sending a drug check over baked goods and giving you warning for not finding anything.
I love that people do shit like this.
The speed of sound in a material is in actuality the "speed of information." If you pulled on a 1 light year long cable a "wave" of force would propagate from where it was pulled along the length of the cable at the speed of sound of that material. For steel this would be approximately 6km/s. The force you apply would take around 50 000 years to reach the other end of the cable.

Edit: to answer your other questions, whether of not you feel the cable move depends on it's thickness. If the cable was thin the force you apply would place the cable under tension and you would feel it stretch as the work you've done is stored as potential energy via Hooke's law. 

The inertia of a cable 1ly long would be literally astronomical however, and so it wouldn't stretch far before you need to apply more force against the resting mass of the rest of the cable. It would eventually begin "moving" as this stretching is transmitted down the cable but it would take years. Most of the cable would still be stationary but the movement you perceive would be the cable stretching over hundreds of thousands of kms as the information "you're being stretched rn." Travels down the cable and the total strain is distributed along it's entire length.
a lot of people are telling you that it’s probably because of LGBTQ related reasons. I’m here to tell you is because you’re someone that likes the chase. You’ve been obsessed with this guy for 2 ish years? You finally asked him out and now that he’s finally into you, he is yours, you’re over it. You’re probably looking for a new guy or gal to crush on (unconsciously). It’s a young people’s game, to find a prey and romance them. 

It’s like how some guys are a flirt and goes out just to get girl’s numbers.

TIFU by joking about decompression chambers for 10+ years
Nearly every bathroom sink in the world needs the faucet to stick out into the sink farther to properly utilize the size of the sink. There is no reason that I should have to shove my hands all the way to the back and rub up against it just to get some water on my hands when the vast majority of the sink is just empty space. It's dumb and we all just accept it.
If you want to be happy, you have to put your happiness above others. I am going through the same thing, went abroad for a few years and it completely changed my perspective. Moving back to India was my worst nightmare, but I knew I had to be confident. People kept telling me “this is India, stop wearing this, don’t talk like this, stop behaving like this”, the best thing to do is just stop listening, and do whatever tf you want. I don’t have any plans of getting married anytime soon and I’ve made it clear to my parents even though they’re against it. I’ve told them I’m not afraid of going to any extent if they try to force me into doing shit that I don’t want to, so they don’t have any other choice but to listen to what I want. I’m an atheist as well and have made it clear to people that I don’t like visiting temples so they shouldn’t be forcing me into doing something I don’t want to do. You have to be assertive to make people listen to you.

There's all the logical answers like people can't pose, bad picture takers or a bad camera. I also think people got a vibe to em, that ya just can't fully feel from photographs. Some people just can naturally bring the energy to the room, or their crooked smile feels so authentic you can't help but smile back at em. Something will just draw you to them even if they're not "conventionally" attractive.

ESH. You did indeed randomly choose a reserved bed, so you should have gone and asked at the desk before taking another. But he also shouldn't have grabbed your stuff, or yelled and woken everyone up. Did the jerk who stole your originally assigned bunk sleep through all of this?
My friend once showed me a thing where the same picture was taken several times with different camera lenses. I know nothing about photography, but I believe the focal length was the attribute that was different. Anyway. The extremes of the scale looked like they were pictures of two completely different people. As they went through the different lenses, the person's face gradually got thinner and pointier (or more full, in the opposite direction).

I'm guessing that may factor into it. I know that my partner, who I met online first, definitely looked different in person versus her pictures. Not in a bad way at all, but I know what you're talking about.
Maybe she did it on purpose because she’s tired of hearing your “joke.”

Your husband does not respect you. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’d suggest for you to be as direct as you can and confront him. No one should be able to get away with this shit.
I came here after I read your other post.

Sounds like you are finally ripping the bandaid off. Hurts as hell at the moment, but the pain will be gone one day and things will be better.

Good luck with your new life. You know this is the end of something bad and a start of something better.
Nothing. It would be so heavy that you wouldn't be able to pull it.

Good to know. I enjoy reading the posts here and sometimes to comment in a supportive fashion. I’d like to know how to post here I need support right now. My daughter responded to a Facebook posting for a rental and it was a scam. She online called the person out and then through messenger the person threaten to murder her and her Family. Put pictures of family members into the Facebook message.  It was reported to Facebook yet there’s been no action and I honestly I’m just disgusted on all levels angry and scared. I feel like I need an Uber geek….. yeah I’m so burnt out probably going to go off Facebook and I told her to also. Yet there’s a couple of groups that I really want to be part of so I’m just treading water at this time.  I am actually quite scared, this person may just be a scammer from another country yet the violence threatening to kill her father,  sister and other family members was a little bit over the top and they posted pictures of these family members.  Again Facebook did not respond. I asked Facebook to deactivate the persons profile and they said no reason to, it was OK.  Thanks for your patience and reading this to whoever did. I am over the solutions and we’ll just hang tight and hopefully not too many people come to break down the door.
The wine is not the problem. But there are so many problems I don’t know where to start. Definitely therapy for you because you were bullied into parenthood then blamed for the consequences
you deserve better, and you can now find it

good on you

i wouldn't say i absolutely crave it, but i also wouldn't say no, i think. my husband and i mainly view sex as just being a fun way to connect with one another, and we have plenty of those. even if i'm really mad at him, i figure that a good way to work things out when an argument doesn't work is to... do something that helps us connect emotionally.

i usually end up feeling better by the end of it.

Oh my God... Does your husband seriously not see how you struggle day to day to make sure your children, who all have their own dietary restrictions, are fed and cared for, which is a full-time job in and of itself? And where does he get off thinking that just because he has a penis, he is entitled to having his own personal chef instead of making his meal like a grown ass adult? NTA. In any way, shape, or form.

I'm sorry if this sounds insensitive, I'm genuinely curious! If you feel like you're being held back and you genuinely feel you'd be happier, assuming you're an adult who doesn't need to rely on family to live, why not just.. stop dealing with the 'cultural nonsense'?

He’s abusive and he wants to control you. Please hear everyone in the comments: these are not normal reactions. Partners don’t blame you for their failures, they don’t say they hate you, they don’t impulsively hang divorce over your head as a punishment, and they don’t force you to drink (or control anything you do) 

He sounds like a monster. I am so sick of seeing men saying they want children, then abandoning the mothers once they’re actually living and breathing. Can’t be bothered to stop being so selfish for a minute
honestly having a picture frame that looks like a mirror and putting some random fucking image in it would be real funny
Every physical medium has a wave propagation speed. That speed is always slower than the speed of light, unless the wave IS light. Then the wave propagates at the speed of light.

The cable does stretch in a very small way, and that stretch-and-contract propagates as a wave.

Not a fuck up. You saved his life, his wife from him, and I suppose his mistress is a happier woman now? 

Enjoy the reward.
Depends on person. Some women I dance with  and we hold and touch each other and its almost always platonic in nature. But once I held a girls hand while dancing and it felt like a slight vibration. And that, coupled with being  close to her while dancing and then there was the way she talked to me  it was very honest. She asked questions and we just hit it off.  We stayed together for almost 9 years. During that time we talked and she said she also felt the vibration the first time we met. And then a few times while we were together.

So i think its the same,  When you met the right person.  But its definitely not every person you see or touch.
You said your family was strict- are they religious? Do they hold certain ideas about abstinence, sex, etc? Were you raised in purity culture?

For everyone posting YTA, yes OP got advance notice, but OP explicitly told her mom not to come because they would be working. Just because you work from home, doesn't mean that you are free to accept visitors. Everyone is ignoring that part. The fact that her parents decided to ignore OP declining the visit is not OP's issue or make them TA, her parents are TA in this case for still showing up. Could OP have suggested to her mother another time, sure, but OP also has a right to not want to visit with this family member at all. 

OP you are NTA and you made your stance pretty clear. Family members especially, like to not take people's work from home seriously, and you have to set those boundaries for them to take you seriously.

EDIT: added NTA at the beginning

I’m tired of being alive.

I feel so hopeless about the future. I’m part of Gen Z, born 1998, and life is so exhausting. I have a college degree, but that’s basically useless unless I get into the graduate school that I applied for. I’m working a low paying job and can’t afford anything after paying off my student loan bills every month. I feel like such a burden to my parents because I can’t afford to live on my own. The future is so dreadful. There is a looming recession. Scientific research and development is being stifled and destroyed. More and more diseases are spreading. Nature will be destroyed by corporations. The orange shitler destroying America will make it impossible to live. Capitalism and Democracy is dead and were heading toward a technofeudalistic society or a total societal collapse. I would rather die than live as a slave to corporations. If there is nothing to look forward to in the future, then what even is the point of living? Isn’t that just prolonging suffering? I’m having more and more suicidal thoughts. I don’t see the point of being alive when the cost of living is so high and I can’t even afford to live anymore. Just being alive feels like such a heavy burden to carry. I just don’t want to exist or at the very least I wish to disappear before shit truly hits the fan.

Good relationships, whether romantic or platonic, are about being able to trust each other and be yourselves. Be a good friend first. Don't worry so much. If her entire perception of you is shot to hell by one awkward moment she's got some issues of her own.

Eric Fischl is really good friends with actor/comedian Steve Martin and asked him to be a guest judge at that year’s contest. I unfortunately didn’t place in the contest due to some issue with my submitted artist statement, but Steve Martin said my self-portrait was his favorite submission, so he purchased it for his own personal collection! I’m still to this day SO honored! I tried to tweet a “thank you” statement to him afterwards, but he never responded.

NTA, of course. Having a stranger come into your home, disrobe, and soak for “extended time periods” in your tub is a very disturbing proposition. 

Good Lord. A bath tub is an extremely intimate hygiene apparatus. And your master bathroom is  an extension of your private, personal space, as much as your bedroom. That alone makes it a hard “No, Sir.”  

I don’t even want to think about a conversation with Dennis about how he would clean the bathroom and tub to your satisfaction after his nice long soak, where he would likely also use your sink and toilet, drip bath water onto your floor, etc.  And would he want to show up in his bathrobe and slippers? Will he bring his own bath mat and towels, cleaning supplies? Maybe he thinks it would be the perfect therapeutic place to clip his toenails, do a bit of various “trimming”, etc., while he’s there. 

Surely your considerate and opinionated neighbor lady also likely has a tub. The very nerve to suggest he use yours instead of hers!

SUCH an ick! factor, it’s giving me the willies.
Thank God. I’m proud of you for leaving and not going back. You only get to live your life once and it’s best to live it with people who add to your life.

Yes, men don’t like that kind of conflict coming from inside the relationship. They will feel trapped. And the fact you got into such a quick relationship, moving in together… that would intensify that feeling.

There’s more going on in your situation. These things are happening due to past experiences. You may need an outside perspective, maybe couples therapy could help 🙂

girl trust when i say it’s not all of them🙏 my friends have gotten literally perfect boyfriends but it’s mainly cause they have the mindset of a MAN and not a BOY. just wait for ur time to get someone trust mee and don’t go looking for someone just wait for it to happen naturally that’s where u get the best relationships! and don’t find someone on snapchat quick add either it won’t ever turn out well lol
Wow, OP. I just read your previous post and now this. I hope it felt cathartic to release all this. Over and over again, she chose THEM, not you or your marriage. Give yourself time to grieve, to cry, to be angry, you deserve that inner closure. Lean into the pain. Eventually, you will heal and you will no longer care and you will find someone who appreciates YOU. Dont let this shitty person poison your thougths and feelings about love and women and relationships. Wake up everyday THANKFUL you never had kids with her. Best of luck to you. Better days are ahead.
It's a catch 22 - needing coffee to be awake, needing to be awake to not forget to place the cup in the machine.

I used to be scared of monsters in my closet and under my bed that I couldn't fall asleep on my own. Dad's solution was a mosquito repellent that he convinced me was a "monster spray". He'd let me keep it bedside "not that you'll need it, but just in case". It had an enlarged picture of a mosquito on the bottle, so I believed that was one of the monsters.

I really relied on that stuff

You need to get into those Facebook comments and start making it clear how weird it is for some random old guy to want to do his weird ice baths in your house. Not only is it weird because you are a young woman, who would be alone with that creepy old man, but if he is soaking in ice water that could be a real health risk, and you don't want to deal with his dead naked wrinkled ass in your bathtub. If your neighbors feel so strongly, they can let him use their bathtubs instead. Put up some cameras because who knows what that old man is going to do next.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > The action I took was declining my neighbor’s request to use my bathtub for his hydrotherapy sessions. I think I may be the asshole because I have extra bathrooms in my home and his health could benefit from using it. I am worried that I may be being selfish in prioritizing my own comfort over helping someone in need.

I don’t like the fact that this meme gets less relatable as I get older BUT I’M NOT OLD I’M NOT EVEN AN ADULT WTF
You look like you communicate in grunts and hand gestures.
If you do anything but ignore it and never mention it again, you're straying into creep territory. It was an accident and meant nothing.
People say this but then go out of their way to pick the biggest dickheads with the most obvious red flags ever
I feel so much for you!  I’ve lived in some metropolitan cities and some rural areas in the Midwest USA and have travelled to Europe and Latin America.  

I’ve seen what a stranglehold some families have over their adult children to uphold their values and traditions.  They even move abroad to get away from the side effects of keeping these traditions and they then go to a different country and STILL expect to live their regular life but better?  Hello!? The only reason that you are thriving better abroad is because they don’t live like your culture!  

I’ve seen it time and again, and it angers me.  No, you will NOT have multiple wives in my country!  NO, you will NOT guilt trip your adult children into accepting an arranged marriage!  No, you will NOT treat my fellow countrymen as less than YOU, the immigrants fleeing from a bad time in your own country.  No, you will NOT carry on with whatever illegal customs you once held in high regard in your old country.  No, you will NOT be contemptuous of the very society that accepted you because they are different….. YOU are the one who is different.  

As an adult, you can begin to take the steps to distance yourself from all of this.  Work two jobs if you have to.  I feel for you, but it’s not the end!  Also, you should probably divorce your husband if he is so closely tied to the old way of life.  He’s just an anchor pulling you down.
A bare handed hand job is better than a blowjob with a condom. If thats not an option jack yourself off.
She’s ignoring clear boundaries and acting like a kid. The razor thing is gross. The bathroom thing shows a lack of respect for shared space. She needs to grow up.
You know the owner will read the note and think “they shouldn’t have been so close to my truck as to get cut”.

I hate being an Indian woman. I often dream of being born in some other country and how nice my life would be
It only works if the kid hates bugs more than they hate lotion.
Brother are you reading my fucking mind???
So, I agree with you, but I think the industry's goal is to make it convenient enough that you don't have to.

But on the topic of kids not knowing how to use the computer or its file management system, that is just sad. And then, they don't even go to YouTube and teach themselves something that they don't know.
Thanks a lot Josh! 😁
It’s really sad that people see nothing wrong with preying on the kindness of others. If you’re a scammer reading this, I hope you eventually realize what you are and change your ways.

Why doesn't she come over when you're there? It sounds suspicious to me.
You're looking for CnC, consensual non-consent. You probably aren't going to find it here on Reddit.

Not my place to judge, I've had partners that were into it, not quite my cup of tea, but anything goes with consenting adults and there's a kink for everything.

Never mind that, there is r/consensualnonconsent
I'm doing everything right, I'm calling my representatives to tell them obvious shit, stuff like, "newsflash idiots, Canada and Greenland independent countries if you have the tiniest shred of decency you'll tell that asshole that conned his way into the White House to leave them the fuck alone," and also "Hey maybe I think trans people (which I am one but I don't tell them that) deserve access to life saving healthcare and abilities to change their names and IDs."

I'm looking for protests to show up at, I'm making sure every fucking person in local politics knows how pissed I am, just like everyone says we need to do if we want to see any change in this shithole of a country. But nothing is changing, hell it's getting worse, so much worse.

Add to that the thought I'll never be able to change anything about this body I hate being stuck in so much (seriously fuck facial hair, I swear it makes me want to claw my own skin off), and the fact that the only thing getting me out of bed most days even before that shitshow of an election in November was just not having the energy to explain why I'm not doing anything, or to explain that most days I consider driving my car off a bridge but don't just because it wouldn't be worth the effort and the repair and medical expenses would put me in a situation ten thousand times worse if I didn't die after that.

I just... I'm tired. Tired of doing the right thing and seeing nothing change, tired of a body that isn't mine, tired of being such a useless sack of human trash that nothing I do matters even slightly. I'm not going to kill myself, but if a car ran me over tomorrow I wouldn't be disappointed that's for sure.
AITA for refusing to let my neighbor use my vintage bathtub for his “therapy” sessions?
Sometimes the old version of a thing was legitimately better. There's a difference between nostalgia and an appreciable difference in quality.
Your eyes look disproportionately small. Like someone hit randomize during character creation
NTA. Just because they respected your wishes and announced it beforehand, does not mean you have to receive them. You said no and they came anyway? How disrespectful of them! Good for you for sticking to your boundary, that must have been hard with them right outside your door. As for the beach thing, it sounds like you handled that fine. They invited you, you gracefully declined because you weren't available. And as for respecting others' culture: that goes both ways. You are a person worthy of respect too.
Boys swear they want genuine love but they don’t act like it.
I forgot that this meme template comes from a movie and I'm amazed that it actually has movement and thought on the hard work behind to animate static images, lol 

Though kudos to you for making the sheets blank from the original drawings in the movie and make the letters go so smooth with the paper!
Speaking of this I have a story

I silently farted in an Uber 

I was in an Uber going home and we pulled up to a stop light when the most unexpected thing happened >! I silently farted!< I don't think the driver noticed since his car smelled like air freshener but for some reason still rolled down the windows
Imagine seeing a Toyota Prius mudding

> clawfoot bathtub from **the 1920s**

I do not think *the industrial revolution* happened when this dude thinks the industrial revolution happened.
I'm gonna echo the other commenter and suggest animated content. it's hard to get over the initial weirdness of animation but the scenes depicted are often scenes that would not be ethical to play out IRL. that's why i personally started looking for 3d animations of various CNC content, cuz it was getting really scarce on regular porn sites, and when I'd find it I'd feel like, 'egh this looks fake,' or 'um this seems super real and it makes me uncomfortable to have watched it' - really challenging to jork it to porn in 2025
lol evolution took a wrong turn at the end
What did he say to make you cum
I understand why they think this, but that doesn't mean that they're right.

So many guys aren't raised to be good boyfriends, and given that this is on r/teenagers, I doubt the guys you're with are wise enough to realize that a relationship is more than just sex (especially since porn addiction has become a massive phantom menace to young people). 

So they go into a relationship with the naive belief that it's all about sex, and that's the only way to show appreciation (either to them or from them). That's obviously not the case. 

On top of that, they see those phrases on the internet a lot. So much so it has become ingrained into their mind because their mind becomes what they feed it. They want someone to love them despite their flaws, yet some flaws need to be fixed.

I totally tripped over her purse and almost squashed her but I spun on the way down so I landed on my back and she landed on top of me,  with her shin in my balls...... it's been about 6 years and I still haven't recovered emotionally......

I understand tariff is a blunt weapon. I also agree tariff needs to be paid the person importing in the Us and not Chinese manufacturer for example. But I feel something is getting lost here. If there is tariff, wouldn’t the importer be able to negotiate the price down at the manufacturer? In essence then China is paying the tariff right? Wouldn’t it eventually come down to the bargaining power of the importer? If yes, then US definitely has the bargaining power as a major consumer for everything ever made everywhere no? Also, tariff on Chinese goods may help rebalance the imports to Vietnam or Mexico and thereby bringing more bargaining power to the importer?

Girl leave. There's no point staying in a relationship when at any given point, it'll be easier and more mentally stable to be alone. Partners are supposed to make your life better. 
Plus, think about it this way- he's told you he doesn't want to be here with all these responsibilities. Why force him? Let him go. It'll be good for you, and he can go frolick with all these imaginary girls he thinks are interested in him.

I have a weird story in reverse.  I was born and raised in a predominantly black area of America. I was in the 10% minority, or less, throughout school.  Ridiculed because I rank one academically in a school where that was unmanly and embarrassing.   Assaulted and beat throughout middle and high school because of my race.  

I learned my race had nothing to do with anything.  The hate these people carried in their soul had nothing to do with me.   I carried success or failure, happiness or sadness with me.   I was content with my lot, even though I was not eligible for scholarships (Due to skin color)  or organizational support since they were not geared to support my race.

I put myself through school doing landscaping, low paid restaurant jobs etc and eventually became successful.

You are perfect exactly how you are right now.   Work to own that, ignore all else and go make your life what you want it to be.   

Be part of my club, my race, those succeed in spite of how the world would like to pigeon hole them.
I have an habit of smelling everything and I don't even realise when I do that. Now my wife has made it a small game for both of us. She points it out whenever I do that. Makes us chuckle
You look pleasantly basic.
It sounds like maybe some avoidant-anxious attachment between you two. If you've never heard of attachment types, it's worth a read. I married an avoidant and leaned anxious before but as a result of this relationship am now more anxious. It can be a terrible mismatch and a lot of pain and struggle in my experience. You sound much like me, your bf sounds like my wife. I fear for you, it's not a fun mix.
So she just walks in your house?  Feels free to walk in your bathroom while you’re in there?
UPDATE: My (F21) guy best friend (M22) drunk kissed me and I can’t stop thinking about it.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > 1. I left my dad, mother and cousin outside of my house for about half an hour under the hot sun because they didn't respect my previously expressed desire for them to not go to my house one day when I was working. I didn't let them in and they had to leave.

2. It might have been cruel or harsh to do this to my own family just because of a personal rule I have against surprise visitors and people that don't respect my desires to not have a visitor. My family has spoken against me saying that I am an asshole for doing that. I kind of felt they may be right and I may be acting a bit too strict.

You’re a grown ass man. Turn that half a spine into a full one, or people will take advantage of you your whole life. I’m sure your parents knows you don’t like him, and it sounds like they want him out of their place cause he sucks to live with. Just so “No thanks, I don’t think it’d work out” if they ask why. And if they keep hounding you, just be honest with them. You don’t have to like shitty people just because they’re related to you
To be honest I don't believe any of this actually happened, but what a trip. 😂 You're a good writer, very entertaining! Would read again.

NTA. Dealing with people who can’t admit their faults is exhausting. You need to sit down and have a specific talk about this issue. Say “I just need to know why you keep violating the requests I’ve made of you, which I see as completely reasonable. If you disagree with them being reasonable, I’d really like to know why.”

I strongly suspect she’ll use something known as DARVO. It stands for “deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.” If she admits to doing it, she’ll minimize the harm. If you press that it bothers you, she’ll bring up things you do that bother her. She’ll probably start in on how you’re being mean. The important thing is to stay on topic- for instance, if she brings up your chores issue, tell her that “unless you’re doing it for revenge, the chores have nothing to do with it.”

Stay on topic, stay calm, don’t let it become a fight about every single little thing that happens in your relationship. “If you want to discuss chores, I’m willing to do that after we resolve this issue. I do care about what you have to say, but this IS an issue we need to resolve.”
You'll survive. Hopefully next shift is better. And dude get up the nerve to ask her out. The worst answer she can give you is a No.
What are you guys doing about the fake posts.  It's become glaringly obvious at this point.

Before you put a sticker over it, you should make it a square by carving it more, then put the sticker on top. Just in case the sticker falls off.
So the potential to be gay aside i went through this  too. My parents weren’t heavily religious I did find with time that I felt very uncomfortable with sex. It felt awkward. Unatural and like i was going through the motions. 

In hindsight i was really shy and really awkward and i would get into my head. I wouldn’t really intense and let myself just *be* to enjoy the moment. 

It’s hard to know what the hang up is for you. He may just be a great guy but not the one for you. I wouldn’t assume sexuality this early or being gay unless you have reasons to beleive so.

I wouldn’t assume sexuality suggest trying to have a bonding session. Tell him you’re having a hard time getting into the moment despite liking him so much. Maybe try having a cuddle session or massage that you both don’t need or intend to go anywhere. And then touch each a little l. See how you feel. Let go of worries about this and just try to enjoy the sensation and try to make it clear when you feel uncomfortable. Communicate even if it’s awkward. 

I think of you guys try that even it’s a few times you might be able to start seeing your answer. Do you feel good when he touches but can’t quite move on from that? Do you find him attractive WHILE he’s touching you? Do you feel comfortable with him as this is happening or super tense?
What’s a hill you’re willing to die on, no matter how stupid it is?
Where else am I gonna talk about how I'm depressed because I'm 8mo pregnant and my boyfriend left me for a gay Jewish Republican who owns a fracking empire?
How do I put this… this seems like the plot of a movie I’d watch at 2 in the morning on Netflix because I took my Ritalin too late and couldn’t fall asleep.

It's very interesting seeing people complaining here about how many rules there are, then complain on other subs like r/AITAH about posts that would be prevented by the rules we have here.

I especially appreciate the no debate posts rule. It prevents the rage bait "trans bad" posts you see everywhere else - the typical "AITA for not calling my friend/child/etc my their preferred pronouns? Their preferred pronouns are the n word and I'm white" kinda shit.
We decided my moms just cursed tbh like now matter what she doesn’t look good in photos
The way this is written should also be banned.
My nana came to see me okay in quite a big orchestra concert when I was a teenager. She was in the early stages of dementia at that point. As I walked on to the stage area along with the other musicians she started tottering over to me right through the orchestra to say hello 🤣
This guy definitely spikes drinks
5.5 is plenty to penetrate. Good thing about doggy is that there are different ways to fuck in doggy. With her having a big ass, you’ll want to have her spread her legs out as far apart as she can, then move her knees toward her chest. This should help spread her cheeks out and give you easier access to her. In my experience with bigger asses this is the best way to do doggy and still penetrate deep enough

Agree 100%. And by the way, back before torrents existed, hell, even back before Napster made downloading music easy, piracy was a lot more interesting. The comraderie, the competition, the networks, the honor between thieves, and the beefs that happened when there was dishonor... Those were really special times!
Lol. I need to know the life this bag of seeds has lived.

Poppycock.
Have you looked at asexuality? I'd like to add, that it does occur on a spectrum. Asexuals may or may not engage in typical sexual activity.


It could also be some level of trauma because of your religious upbringing. There are Christian oriented sex counselors too that can talk to you. I took a class with an erotica author that moonlighted as a guest for a woman that worked with Christian couples struggling with sex.
You should've just explained what you thought she was doing. This was only slightly awkward until you made it absurdly awkward.
Pls add it to the mobile report-> which rule does it break. Me too Thanks.
She's dating someone so young to try and make you jealous... That's... Pathetic.

Does 0:47 sounds like Minecraft chicken SFX or am I crazy?
Kinda funny but I wouldn't let it bother you lol. Imo having a sense of humour, however dorky can be attractive.
Well to echo my statement from the other thread, we Canadians are feeling pretty at risk. Poland in the summer of 1939, really. It feels like the world is a tinderbox just waiting for a spark that burns down  the rules based order - the unified belief in the rule of law - of the better part of the last century.

The unimaginable words of planned conquest coming out of the mouth of an American president would have been beyond belief short years ago.
The reason why something's go I pirated is a price point, availability, and convenience combination helps prevent piracy. I think that Spotify is super convenient to use, readily available, and at a low price of $10/ month? Bo brainer. I put so many hours into Spotify listening that it's super worth it.  The same used to be true for video streaming services. Now everything is so segmented and a hassle and expensive. There's no way I'm paying for every service. I'll either hop around or pirate the stuff I want to see.
Seems legit
So basically, you're less than half a year in, already have mismatched sexual desires, don't align on demonstrations of intimacy, and fight all the time....

Hi! Just here to say I love Reddit and it’s made my crazy brain thoughts on some things not feel so crazy! 🤪
>My family is on his side; they're saying I'm "neglecting" him and that men don't usually have to worry about their own dinner and I need to make sure he's fed good like me and the kids.

"Husband wouldn't have to worry about his own dinner if he wasn't being as picky as one of the children. Those 'men' you are talking about? Those traditional men who thought cooking was women's work? They wouldn't be on some pretentious diet that literally excludes meat and potatoes, and they wouldn't refuse to talk about what meals *are* acceptable. And they *certainly* wouldn't go running to their wife's mommy and daddy to complain that they don't want to eat their vegetables."

NTA. Your husband is behaving like a spoiled child and your family are AHs for getting involved at all in such a petty complaint, and even worse for taking his side. 

And their argument is ridiculous anyway: my grandfather was part of the generation where a lot of men prided themselves on not being involved in so-called women's work like cooking. But that meant he *never* complained about the meals my grandmother made for him -- and she was *not* a good cook according to her children.

But even if it was legitimate to say that cooking dinner was uniquely the wife's role in general (which it's not), you have children with special health needs. Even my very traditional grandfather understood that parents needed to prioritize the kids' needs first, and wouldn't have dreamed about whining in a situation like this 

But also, it really concerns me that your husband has made *your* family into *his* allies, particularly in a situation where he is so obviously in the wrong. It makes me wonder what other manipulative and controlling tactics he is using on you. 

I'm going to strongly encourage you to read this book and see if other parts of this sound like your husband: https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf

You're measuring the length of the cable being one lightyear long, however, when pulled, the force would propogate through the material at varying rates. It depends on what type of material, and the force propogates at the speed of sound, not of light, which is much slower.

Sound propogates through steel at roughly  5.900 m/s, so if you took someone and placed them 6m away, there would be a small latency between the action and noticing it. 

This is a very, very basic explaination, but the problem is a little more complicated.

- I didn’t notify staff about the bed mix-up when I first arrived (I assumed empty bunks were fair game especially top ones).  
- I refused to move immediately when confronted, which escalated the argument.  
-  I might have 'stole' his assigned bed, even though mine was occupied first.

Do not worry about it, i know it might be hard to believe but butt is squishy and will not be an obsacle to you in this regard, half the fun is butt being in the way.

Literally spread and clap them cheecks, have fun.

Also bro tip, if you feel like you might be short for the task (you are not), you don't have to thrust all the way in and out, focus on being all the way in, the move backwards ever so slighty, and slam back, trust me.

Please don't answer the obvious "they don't" I hear that enough everywhere already, I'm looking to see if anyone can provide an articulate, logical answer to this question.



IF the Rep leadership truly believes what they claim about how Liberals/Leftists would start an authoritarian witch hunt, take all the guns, etc. if/when they come back into power, THEN why did they support Trump's case for presidential immunity (basically flushing the system of checks and balances after wiping with it) IF they expected there was virtually any risk of their opponents regaining that presidential power again down the line?

  
I recognize the bipartisan consolidation of power, but it's a major false equivalence to compare the increasing number of Exec orders from both R and D presidents to the unilateral damage done to the process of impeachment for holding presidents accountable for crimes, one of the \*biggest\* differences between a President and a King/Tyrant
